# Piped Piper

For this project I used the python framework called flask which allows us to build web applications, in this small project I created an application in charge of monitoring the status of certain devices such as switches, routers, among other aspects of their performance. Add tests to be able to improve the product. For the database I used SQLite, we were also using ORM to make our queries to the database more readable. The project can also print a pdf file with the information of the devices which we select.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate the cloned directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the command:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the main script using the command `python run.py` or you can run the test with the command `pytest`
